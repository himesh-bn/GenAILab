-> Objective
The primary goal of this experiment is to extract text from a file stored in Google Drive and generate a concise summary using Cohere’s NLP model. The experiment integrates Google Drive API for data retrieval, LangChain for structured prompt generation, and Cohere API for text summarization.

-> Overview
This experiment demonstrates how Natural Language Processing (NLP) can be leveraged to automate the summarization of large text files stored on the cloud. The process involves authenticating with Google Drive, retrieving file content, formatting the text using prompt engineering, and then generating a summary using Cohere’s language model.

-> Methodology
  1.Google Drive Authentication & Text Retrieval
    OAuth 2.0 authentication is used to securely access files in Google Drive.
    If authentication is successful, the script fetches the text content of the specified file.

  2.Prompt Engineering with LangChain
    A structured prompt is defined using LangChain's PromptTemplate to ensure better summarization.
    The text content is inserted into the prompt before sending it to Cohere’s API.
 
  3.Summarization Using Cohere API
    Cohere's text generation model is used to generate a concise summary.
    The generated summary is printed as output.

-> Hypothesis
    If a large text file is provided, the system should be able to generate a coherent, concise, and meaningful summary.
    The quality of the summary will depend on the effectiveness of the prompt and the capabilities of Cohere’s NLP model.
    
-> Expected Outcome
    The system will successfully retrieve a file from Google Drive and extract its text.
    The text will be efficiently summarized using Cohere’s AI model, reducing the length while preserving key information.
    The approach can be extended to summarize multiple files, different text formats, and integrate with other AI models for comparison.

-> Applications
  1.Automating document summarization for businesses.
  2.Quickly extracting key insights from large reports or research papers.
  3.Enhancing productivity by reducing manual summarization efforts.
